# Installator
A modular installator for python apps

This is a application to install python apps that need to be downloaded. It has only be tested on git hub repos but it can work for any URL.

The idea of this project is to create a generic and dynamic module that can be used to install an app and/or also could be part of a specific app to do updates.
It to work with a web authentication if need it. (Currently tested in Git private and public)

It has a module "Checks" that can be modified to meet any needs for files that have been installed in the system.

Currently supports zip compressed files but the idea is to extend it over time.

If you want to contribute to this project feel free to do so, for specs as this is a simple project, just follow the ones that these files have.
